        "Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the
        Asgardians, a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of
        Asgard, the Realm Eternal. Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and
        king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as Vikings and
        became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer
        Mjolnir, which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the
        mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. When his irresponsible and
        impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard (more
        commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named
        Donald Blake, stripped of his memory. After learning humility he
        regained his memory as well as his godly powers. Thor went on to become
        a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the
        Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".
